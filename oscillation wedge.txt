Here is a complete, self‑contained LaTeX snippet that states and proves the requested Oscillation ⇒ Wedge lemma with precise regularity hypotheses. I give both a BV (distributional) version—natural for boundary phases—and an absolutely‑continuous corollary in the exact “∫I(−w′)\int_I(-w')” form you asked for.
Note on hypotheses. A one‑sided bound on the phase drop alone cannot pin the phase into a symmetric wedge: it prevents large decreases but allows unbounded increases. The wedge conclusion therefore requires the same oscillation bound for ww and for −w-w (equivalently, uniform bounds on both negative and positive variation). In the proof map this “other side” is obtained by applying the same certificate to the reciprocal/rotated Cayley transform; here we take it as an explicit assumption.

\paragraph{Notation.}
For a real function $w$ on $\mathbb{R}$ of locally bounded variation (BV), let $Dw$ denote its distributional derivative, a finite signed Radon measure on compact intervals, with Jordan decomposition
\[
Dw = \mu^+ - \mu^- , \qquad \mu^\pm \ \text{finite positive measures.}
\]
For a bounded open interval $I\subset\mathbb{R}$ we write
$\mu^\pm(I)$ for the positive/negative variation of $w$ on $I$.


\begin{lemma}[Oscillation $\Rightarrow$ Wedge (BV form)]
\label{lem:OscToWedgeBV}
Let $w:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ be locally of bounded variation. Assume:


\medskip
\noindent\emph{(A) Two-sided oscillation bound.} For every bounded open interval $I\subset\mathbb{R}$,
\[
\mu^-(I)\ \le\ \frac{\pi}{2}
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\mu^+(I)\ \le\ \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]


\noindent\emph{(B) Anchor.} There exists a Lebesgue point $t_\star\in\mathbb{R}$ at which $w$ is approximately continuous and
\[
w(t_\star)=0.
\]


Then $w(t)\in[-\tfrac{\pi}{2},\,\tfrac{\pi}{2}]$ for almost every $t\in\mathbb{R}$.
\end{lemma}


\begin{proof}
Let $J=(a,b)$ be any bounded open interval with $a<b$ such that $a,b$ are points of approximate continuity of $w$ (this holds for almost every choice of endpoints because BV functions are approximately continuous a.e.). The fundamental theorem for BV functions gives
\[
w(b)-w(a)\ =\ Dw((a,b))\ =\ \mu^+((a,b))\ -\ \mu^-((a,b)).
\]
By (A), $0\le \mu^\pm((a,b))\le \pi/2$, hence
\[
-\frac{\pi}{2}\ \le\ w(b)-w(a)\ \le\ \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]
Fix the anchored point $t_\star$ from (B), and take any $t\in\mathbb{R}$ which is a point of approximate continuity. Apply the previous inequality to the interval whose endpoints are $t_\star$ and $t$ (choosing the order so that it is $(\min\{t,t_\star\},\max\{t,t_\star\})$). We obtain
\[
-\frac{\pi}{2}\ \le\ w(t)-w(t_\star)\ \le\ \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]
Because $w(t_\star)=0$ by (B), this simplifies to
$|w(t)|\le \pi/2$ for almost every $t$. This is precisely the desired wedge inclusion.
\end{proof}


\begin{remark}
The anchor $w(t_\star)=0$ pins the absolute phase. Without it, (A) still implies that the essential range of $w$ has diameter at most $\pi/2$, i.e., $|w(t)-w(s)|\le \pi/2$ for a.e.\ $s,t$, but this only localizes $w$ to some (a priori unknown) interval of length $\pi/2$. In applications one fixes the branch of the argument so that $w$ vanishes at a designated reference ordinate (e.g., the center of a Carleson box), which is exactly hypothesis (B).
\end{remark}


\begin{corollary}[Absolutely continuous form]
\label{cor:AC}
Let $w\in W^{1,1}_{\mathrm{loc}}(\mathbb{R})$ be real-valued and suppose that for every bounded open interval $I\subset\mathbb{R}$
\[
\int_I (-w'(t))\,dt\ \le\ \frac{\pi}{2}
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\int_I (\,w'(t)\,)\,dt\ \le\ \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]
Assume also that there is $t_\star$ with $w(t_\star)=0$. Then $w(t)\in[-\tfrac{\pi}{2},\,\tfrac{\pi}{2}]$ for almost every $t\in\mathbb{R}$.
\end{corollary}


\begin{proof}
For $w\in W^{1,1}_{\mathrm{loc}}$, the BV measures are absolutely continuous:
$\mu^+(I)=\int_I (w')_+\,dt$ and $\mu^-(I)=\int_I (w')_-\,dt$,
and $w(b)-w(a)=\int_a^b w'$. The two integral hypotheses are equivalent to
$\mu^\pm(I)\le \pi/2$ for all bounded $I$, so Lemma~\ref{lem:OscToWedgeBV}
applies.
\end{proof}


\begin{remark}[How the hypotheses are met in the proof map]
In the proof map, $w$ is the boundary phase (argument) of a neutralized analytic function on a Carleson box; such $w$ is locally BV away from a null set. The ``certificate'' bounds give a uniform estimate on the phase drop; applying the same mechanism to the reciprocal/rotated Cayley transform yields the matching estimate for the phase rise, which is assumption (A). The phase branch is fixed so that $w=0$ at the box center (assumption (B)). Lemma~\ref{lem:OscToWedgeBV} then delivers the boundary wedge $w\in[-\pi/2,\pi/2]$ a.e.\ on the box.
\end{remark}

What this accomplishes
* It isolates the exact mathematical mechanism: uniform two‑sided local variation bounds + a single anchor point ⇒ pointwise wedge a.e.

* It is robust to jumps and purely singular parts (BV), which is appropriate for boundary traces.

* It makes explicit why a strictly one‑sided bound is insufficient and how the “other side” is supplied in the RH framework (by symmetry via the reciprocal/rotated transform).
