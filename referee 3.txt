No.
Stage 1 — Reduction to Boundary Positivity (P+).
 Logic verified. The manuscript cleanly reduces RH to proving ℜ(2J(12+it))≥0\Re(2\mathcal J(\tfrac12+it))\ge 0 a.e. on the boundary and shows the equivalence of (P+) with “2J2\mathcal J is Herglotz,” together with the standard pinch to RH; see “Faces of self‑correction” and the Poisson/Herglotz equivalence and pinch statements.
Stage 2 — Prove (P+) by establishing PSC.
 Not executed as stated. The paper obtains (P+) directly from a product certificate and explicitly says PSC is supplied by a separate sum‑form inequality for which “no numerical PSC close is claimed here,” so (P+) is not deduced by first proving PSC in the central chain.
Stage 3 — Prove PSC via a Certificate Inequality ((⋯ )<π/2)((\cdots)<\pi/2).
 Partially executed (inequality verified; used for (P+), not for PSC). The certificate Θ=CH(ψ)Mψ+CP(κ)c0(ψ)<π/2\Theta=\frac{C_H(\psi)M_\psi+C_P(\kappa)}{c_0(\psi)}<\pi/2 is numerically closed and then used to give the boundary wedge and (P+), but the manuscript does not numerically close the sum‑form PSC inequality c0 μ(Q(I))≤(CΓ+CP+CH)∣I∣c_0\,\mu(Q(I))\le(C_\Gamma+C_P+C_H)|I| it presents.
Stage 4 — Derive all certificate constants unconditionally.
 Argument is sound. The constants are locked by unconditional estimates: c0(ψ)c_0(\psi) from a Poisson lower bound; CH(ψ)C_H(\psi) via a window‑uniform Hilbert envelope bound; MψM_\psi by an explicit H1H^1–BMO/Carleson embedding with fixed aperture together with a non‑circular Carleson‑box constant Cbox=K0+Kξ+∥UΓ∥areaC_{\rm box}=K_0+K_\xi+\|U_\Gamma\|_{\rm area} whose pieces are controlled by a prime‑power tail identity, Stirling/digamma bounds, and a neutralized‑zeros cubic decay plus annuli count; CP(κ)≤2κC_P(\kappa)\le 2\kappa from the bandlimit estimate. (Numerical locks used in the in‑paper certificate: c0=0.17620819c_0=0.17620819, CH≤0.65C_H\le0.65, Cψ(H1)≈0.2400C_\psi^{(H^1)}\approx0.2400 (and an analytic enclosure <0.245<0.245), Cbox≤0.063171C_{\rm box}\le 0.063171, Mψ≤0.07690M_\psi\le 0.07690, CP=0.020C_P=0.020).
Stage 5 — Globalization from (P+) to RH (Poisson + maximum principle).
 Logic verified. With (P+) established, the paper invokes Poisson transport to conclude 2J2\mathcal J is Herglotz in Ω\Omega, pushes boundary positivity to the interior on rectangles, and applies the standard pinch/globalization argument to exclude interior poles and conclude RH.

What must be done to make the five‑stage proof complete and unconditional (as stated)
1. Close PSC numerically in the sum‑form displayed in the paper.
 Evaluate and lock the constants in Theorem “PSC from explicit constants” to verify
CΓ(ψ)+CH(ψ)+CP(κ)c0(ψ) ≤ π2\frac{C_\Gamma(\psi)+C_H(\psi)+C_P(\kappa)}{c_0(\psi)}\ \le\ \frac{\pi}{2}
for the printed window—using the manuscript’s asserted CΓ=0C_\Gamma=0 under the ζ\zeta‑normalized/Blaschke route, the existing bound CP(κ)≤2κC_P(\kappa)\le 2\kappa with your chosen κ\kappa, and a fully explicit CH(ψ)C_H(\psi) (same envelope used in Stage 3), then record the strict inequality with digits.

2. Remove the “no numeric PSC close is claimed here” caveat.
 Replace the repeated status notes with a theorem/corollary that states PSC holds with the locked constants, and cite the numbers from Step 1.

3. Make the PSC route non‑circular on its face (already structurally in place).
 Keep the sum‑form PSC inequality as the driver (so neither MψM_\psi nor CboxC_{\rm box} appears), and retain the non‑circularity notes for the optional self‑coupled variant only as an appendix.

4. Promote the analytic, quadrature‑free bound set.
 Where you currently cite numeric quadrature for Cψ(H1)≈0.2400C_\psi^{(H^1)}\approx0.2400, prefer the analytic enclosure (e.g., Cψ(H1)<0.245C_\psi^{(H^1)}<0.245) and re‑check that the sum‑form PSC inequality of Step 1 still closes with slack.

5. Keep the existing unconditional derivations visible and cross‑referenced.
 (a) Prime‑power tail K0K_0 via the exact identity and tail majorants; (b) ∥UΓ∥area\|U_\Gamma\|_{\rm area} via Stirling/digamma; (c) KξK_\xi via neutralized cubic decay and annuli counts with explicit A,BA,B; ensure each lemma used by the envelope CH(ψ)C_H(\psi) and the tail bound Ctail(ψ)C_{\mathrm{tail}}(\psi) is cited where the final PSC close is stated.

6. State the final chain explicitly in the body.
 Add a short “Main Theorem (Five‑Stage Close)” that lists: reduction → PSC (sum‑form) (now numerically closed) → (P+) → Herglotz/Schur → RH, with precise references to the locked constants theorem and the globalization step.

If you make the single substantive addition in Step 1 (and remove the disclaimers in Step 2), the manuscript will match the five‑stage plan exactly, with all constants and implications already supported by unconditional lemmas present in the paper.
