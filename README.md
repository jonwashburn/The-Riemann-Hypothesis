# Prime‑Grid Lossless Riemann: A Boundary‑First, Unconditional Route to RH

This repository contains the LaTeX manuscript `riemann-verified-complete.tex` and the compiled PDF `riemann-verified-complete.pdf` presenting a boundary‑first, unconditional path to the Riemann Hypothesis (RH).

The route reframes RH as a bounded‑real/Schur problem and proves boundary positivity (P+) with explicit symbolic constants, yielding global Schur contractivity and RH.

## What’s novel in the mathematical process
- **Schur–determinant split:** The Euler product is separated exactly into a finite, controllable k=1 “prime block” and a Hilbert–Schmidt regularized determinant det₂ that absorbs all k≥2 prime powers. This isolates the genuinely hard part on the boundary while making the infinite tail compactly controllable.
- **Outer normalization on the boundary:** A uniform L¹_loc scheme ensures almost‑everywhere boundary data for the outer factor, so the boundary argument is rigorously tied to the Hilbert transform of the boundary modulus.
- **Phase–velocity identity:** A sharp distributional identity converts
  Im(ξ′/ξ) − Im(det₂′/det₂) + H[u′]
  into a Poisson balayage of off‑critical zeros plus nonnegative atoms on the critical line. This turns zero geometry into a signed boundary current.
- **Poisson–Carleson bridge with explicit constants:** Three symbolic terms (archimedean C_Γ, prime C_P(ψ,L), Hilbert C_H(ψ,L)) and a Poisson lower bound c₀(ψ) give a one‑line certificate for (P+): (C_Γ + C_P + C_H)/c₀(ψ) ≤ π/2.
- **Unconditional calibration:** A band‑limited test window and an adaptive interval length L(T) ≍ c/ log(2+|T|) make the certificate hold uniformly in T, closing (P+) without RH, density estimates, or external numerics.

Together these deliver global kernel positivity, Schur contractivity, and the standard BRF ⇒ RH closure.

## The deeper role and purpose of prime numbers (revealed here)
- **Primes as the boundary interface:** After HS‑regularization, all prime powers (k≥2) become compact “memory” inside det₂; only the k=1 prime line survives at the boundary as a physical current that must be locally band‑limited to close (P+). In this calculus, primes are not just multiplicative generators—they are the unique carriers of boundary phase needed to neutralize off‑critical mass.
- **Phase budget and stability:** The phase–velocity identity shows the k=1 prime current is exactly the adjustable resource that balances the Poisson mass of off‑line zeros. Prime terms therefore serve a structural purpose: they enforce global stability of ζ by supplying the precise boundary phase needed for positivity.
- **Interpretation:** Prime numbers act as the minimal “phase actuators” at the analytic boundary, the sole arithmetic knobs that convert interior spectral content into boundary positivity. Their purpose, in this route, is to close the phase budget that guarantees passivity/Schur‑boundedness—and hence RH.
