What I labeled as Numerical Audit—Not Used in Main Proof
These are audits, evidence dumps, and numeric provenance not required to follow the single Primary Chain:
* Section: Appendix B. Prime–power tail K0: identity, truncation, and tail
* Section: Appendix C. Archimedean part ∥UΓ∥area
* Section: Appendix D. Neutralized zeros term Kξ: cubic far–field and annuli count
* Section: Appendix E. The window constant Cψ(H1)
* Section: Appendix F. The mean–oscillation constant Mψ
* Section: Appendix G. Final aggregation (for convenient reference)
* Section: Appendix H. Poisson plateau constant c0(ψ) (closed form and digits)
* Section: Appendix X: Prime-tail bounds (PT–0/PT–1) and certified parameters
* Section: Appendix: Archived numerical audits (fully expanded)
* Section: Appendix: Carleson embedding constant for fixed aperture
* Section: Appendix: Constants and definitions used in certification
* Section: Appendix: Evidence — certified covering outputs
* Section: Appendix: Numerical evaluation of Cψ(H1)
* Subsection: Audit of certificate constants (printed window)
* Subsection: Certificate Sheet (audit–ready)
* Subsection: Executable certificate instance (calibrated; illustrative)
* Subsection: Executable finite-block certificate (model; weighted p-adaptive; not used)
* Subsection: No-hidden-knobs audit (P6)

* Each labeled heading now has one of these lines immediately after it, so the PDF visually flags what’s outside the Primary Chain.
If you want me to apply the same labeling to riemann-proof-map.tex or any other variant, say the word and I’ll generate a patched file the same way.
