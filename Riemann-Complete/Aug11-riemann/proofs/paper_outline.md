## Introduction
- Motivation: BRF formulation \(\Re\big(2\,\det_2(I-A(s))/\xi(s)-1\big)\ge 0\) on \(\Omega:=\{\Re s>\tfrac12\}\)
- Conceptual bridge: Schur transform \(\Theta=(H-1)/(H+1)\), Pick kernels, and passivity
- Contributions: concise bullets (see below)
- High-level structure of the paper

## Main contributions (bulleted)
- Schur–determinant splitting (finite vs. HS parts) for the zeta operator block
- HS control of prime-truncations and HS→det₂ local-uniform convergence
- Division by \(\xi\) on zero-free compacts; normal-family bounds
- Finite-stage passive constructions via lossless KYP (prime-grid, explicit)
- Alignment/closure: convergence of finite-stage models to the target \(H\)
- Consolidated BRF/Schur/Pick equivalences and proof strategy

## Setup and notation
- Domain: \(\Omega:=\{\Re s>\tfrac12\}\)
- Arithmetic block: \(A(s):\ell^2(\mathcal P)\to\ell^2(\mathcal P)\), \(A(s)e_p:=p^{-s}e_p\); HS bound and operator norm bounds
- Completed zeta: \(\xi(s)=\tfrac12 s(1-s)\pi^{-s/2}\Gamma(s/2)\zeta(s)\)
- Regularized determinant: \(\det_2\)
- Target functions: \(H(s):=2\,\det_2(I-A(s))/\xi(s)-1\), \(\Theta(s):=(H-1)/(H+1)\)

## Schur–determinant identity and mass splitting
- Statement of the identity and the interpretation of \(k\ge 2\) vs. \(k=1\) terms
- Placement of archimedean and pole corrections in the finite block

## HS continuity and det₂ convergence
- Proposition: HS convergence \(A_N\to A\) on compacts implies \(\det_2(I-A_N)\to\det_2(I-A)\) locally uniformly
- Carleman bound, normal-family/Vitali arguments (compact statements)

## Division by \(\xi\) off its zeros and Herglotz/Schur closure
- Corollary: local-uniform convergence for \(H_N\) on zero-free compacts
- Lemma: Herglotz (and Schur/PSD kernel) classes closed under local-uniform limits

## Finite-stage passive constructions (lossless KYP)
- Lemma (one-line factorization): if \(A^*P+PA+C^*C=0\), \(PB+C^*D=0\), \(D^*D=I\) then \(\|D+C(sI-A)^{-1}B\|_\infty\le 1\)

### Final specification: Prime-grid lossless (Option B)
- Primes \(p_1<\dots<p_N\)
- \(\Lambda_N:=\mathrm{diag}\big(\tfrac{2}{\log p_1},\dots,\tfrac{2}{\log p_N}\big)\)
- \(A_N:=-\Lambda_N\), \(P_N:=I_N\), \(C_N:=\sqrt{2\Lambda_N}\)
- \(D_N:=-I_N\) (unitary dilation with scalar effective feedthrough \(-1\))
- \(B_N:=-C_N^*D_N=C_N\)
- Scalar port extraction: choose unit vectors \(u,v\in\mathbb C^N\), set \(h_N(s):=v^*H_N(s)u\); then \(\|h_N\|_\infty\le 1\)

## Alignment and closure to the limit
- Statement: the prime-grid lossless sequence together with the HS→det₂ convergence and closure yields \(H\) Herglotz / \(\Theta\) Schur on \(\Omega\)
- Brief roadmap: boundedness, asymptotic control, normal-family argument, uniform convergence on compacts

## Main theorem and equivalent formulations
- Theorem (BRF): \(\Re\,H(s)\ge 0\) on \(\Omega\)
- Equivalences: Schur bound for \(\Theta\), Pick kernel PSD
- Sketch of proof referencing the previous sections
